# CrawlerLike
This is a work-in-progress roguelike dungeon crawler built in C with SDL2.

## Compiling

Download and install the SDL2 library (https://www.libsdl.org). I recommend installing SDL2 with the "Unix Way" Instructions for MacOS. After installing SDL2, clone, compile, and run the program like so:

    git clone https://github.com/ethinethin/CrawlerLike
    cd CrawlerLike
    make
    ./crawler
